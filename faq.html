            <h3>What is the point of BSON when it is no smaller than
            JSON in many cases?</h3>
            <p>BSON is designed to be efficient in space, but in many
            cases is not much more efficient than JSON. In some cases
            BSON uses even more space than JSON. The reason for this
            is another of the BSON design goals: traversability. BSON
            adds some "extra" information to documents, like length
            prefixes, that make it easy and fast to traverse.</p>

            <p>BSON is also designed to be fast to encode and
            decode. For example, integers are stored as 32 (or 64) bit
            integers, so they don't need to be parsed to and from
            text. This uses more space than JSON for small integers,
            but is much faster to parse.</p>

            <h3>Where can I get more help/infomation?</h3>
            <p>The best place to ask questions about BSON is on
            the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/bson">BSON
            mailing list</a>.</p>
